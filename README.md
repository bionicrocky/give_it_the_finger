# giveitthenfinger
Allows sudo via fingerprint on MacOS in iTerm2 if you have TouchID enabled device connected or you are using your MacBook (Apple Silicon) keyboard- otherwise just prompts for password.  Includes undo script.

Be sure to "chmod +x install_touchid_sudo.sh uninstall_touchid_sudo.sh
./install_touchid_sudo.sh"

Install makes timestamped .bak files for everything they touch and keep a manifest so you can fully revert.

Open a new iTerm2 tab or run source ~/.zshrc.
